# hi there, welcome! 👋

katherine (she/her): hong kong–born / los angeles–bound creative coder, data visualiser, amateur linguist, interactive designer, accessibility and museum and urbanism enthusiast, academia nerd.

i love using HTML/CSS/JS, Python, and Processing to make experiments and tools and art! coding is a thrilling thing and the goal is to expand the possibilities and include as many people as possible in it. i'm currently working towards a degree in Media Arts + Practice at USC School of Cinematic Arts, and hoping to spend a lot of time in the future making interactive articles, websites, and experiences to communicate information and inspire through storytelling.

here are some tech things that make me giddy or galvanised, and some people who inspire those feelings:

- algorithmic oppression, surveillance culture ← [Safiya Noble](https://safiyaunoble.com/), [Olivia McKayla Ross](https://oross.net/), [mango.pdf ("Alex")](https://mango.pdf.zone/)
- internet culture, internet linguistics, net art ← [Gretchen McCulloch](https://gretchenmcculloch.com/)
